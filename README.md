# primorial_of_a_number

The following code was developed for my Ap Computer Science class.
Hopefully having this on github wont be an issue...

I think this is the fastest way to generate a primorial of a number, if i am wrong and there are faster solutions, please dm me on discord Egg#8569

-TODO finish this readme
-TODO Use ratatui instead of tui-rs

-TODO add tests for each function in lib
-TODO make this installable with cargo install

-I have noticed issues with tui's user input while windows and i do need to fix that i know it works perfectly on linux though
 
To install and run for yourself, use the lib file in your own code, or for a tui interface git clone the project and run in your terminal with cargo
